--- Stop public entity methods from accessing property setters
--- Stop public entity methods from creating other entities
--- Require all entities to be partial for source generation
--- Force declaration of internal/protected/private constructor on entities
    in order to avoid default public constructors 
--- IIntegrationEvent<> implementers must be top-level classes who's syntax node parent is the namespace. 
    Otherwise it would add too much complexity in the analyses.
-- IIntegrationEvent<> implementers must be partial
--- Assignment/adding to non-public fields via public method is not allowed
-- Figure out a way to put RoslynHelpers in a separate project so that it can be reused with source generators
Currently, for some reason not known to me, I cannot put this static class into 
 CleanArchitecture.Core.Roslyn.Helpers and reference it from this project and use in my diagnostics...
